#Speech generator
A small program I made to turn perfectly good writing into nonsensical gibberish

Simply create a file called input.txt with any input you want, and watch as the program turns your coherent thoughts into a pile of weighted psuedo-random nonsense.

##Why?!
I wanted to play around with natural language processing with Python
